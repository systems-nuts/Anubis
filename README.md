# Anubis
### General
Please check fs/proc/kvm_new.c for debug and test

Most of the file change are in kernel/sched/fair.c 

and arch/x86/kvm 

The code is still prototype, Not fully clean and perfect coded. 

the guest require the 4.14 guest 

We will update more test case soon 
### Test
##### Preparation 
---
1. Before start the VMs, in the host we need `sudo echo 0xd300 > /proc/ct_offset`.
2. Start the VMs(with correct kernel version).
3. While starting the VMs, do `cat /proc/burrito_flag` to open for 1 sec and `cat /proc/burrito_flag` again.
4. Use `cat /proc/vcpu_list_show` to check if success (all vCPUs value not zero)
5. Use `virsh vcpupin` to bind running VM's vCPU.
6. Create the CPU backgroud pressure `sysbench cpu --time=99999999 --threads={Nr of vCPUs} run &`

##### Example 
---
```
sysbench fileio --file-total-size=10G --file-test-mode=seqrd --time=40 --max-requests=0 --file-extra-flags=direct --report-interval=5 --percentile=99 --threads=1 run
```
